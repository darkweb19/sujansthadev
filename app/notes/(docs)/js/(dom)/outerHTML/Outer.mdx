import CodePreview from "@/components/Notes/CodePreview";
import { outerCode, otherCode } from "./Code";

The outerHTML property is a part of the JavaScript HTMLElement object and it allows developers to access and manipulate the entire HTML of an element, including the element's own tags. The outerHTML property returns the entire HTML of an element, as a string of HTML.

For example :

<CodePreview code={outerCode} />

The following JavaScript code can be used to access the `<div>` element with the ID "myDiv" and change its content:

<CodePreview code={otherCode} />

The outerHTML property is a powerful tool for manipulating the entire HTML of an element. Developers can use it to add, remove, or replace elements, as well as change the text and attributes of existing elements. The main difference between outerHTML and innerHTML is that outerHTML allows you to change the entire element, including its own tags, whereas innerHTML only allows you to change the content within the element.

It's important to note that the outerHTML property can be used to insert any valid HTML code, including scripts and event handlers. This can be a powerful feature, but it can also pose a security risk if the HTML is not properly sanitized. Also, it's important to note that when you set the outerHTML property, the entire element is replaced, any previous content, event handlers, and other properties are lost.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the outerHTML property is a powerful tool for manipulating the entire HTML of an element in JavaScript. Understanding how to use this property is essential for creating dynamic and interactive web pages, as it allows developers to easily add, remove, or replace elements, as well as change the text and attributes of existing elements. However, it's important to keep in mind that this property can pose a security risk if the HTML is not properly sanitized and also, it completely replaces the entire element when set.
