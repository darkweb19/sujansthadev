## Key Characteristics of HTML Links

-   Specified by the `<a>`tag.
-   Also known as hyperlinks.
-   Used to link one document to another.
-   Includes a closing tag `</a>`.

## Syntax of HTML Links

<CodePreview code={codeHtmls} />

### Essential Attributes of the Anchor Tag

HTML links primarily use two attributes:

-   **href attribute:** Defines the URL the link points to.
-   **target attribute:** Specifies where to open the linked document.

### Target Attribute Values

-   **\_blank:** Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.
-   **\_top:** Opens document in the full body of the window.
-   **\_self:** Opens document in the same window or tab (default behavior).
-   **\_parent:** Opens the linked document in the parent frame.

### Linking to Specific Page Sections

To link to a specific section of a webpage, you can:

-   Use the name or id attribute of the target section.
-   Use a hyperlink with a hash **`(#)`** followed by the target id or name.

### Example

Let's say you have a long webpage with multiple sections, and you want to create a link at the top that, when clicked, takes the user directly to a specific section further down the page. You can do this using HTML links that target specific sections.

### Link Colors

Links typically appear in different colors based on their state:

-   Active: Displayed in red and underlined like this sentence
-   Visited: Appears purple and underlined like this sentence
-   Unvisited: Shown as blue and underlined like this sentence

You can customize these colors using CSS to better match the style of your website.
